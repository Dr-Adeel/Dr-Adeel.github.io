                    <h3>Business Process Maintenance: Case of Business Processes</h3>
                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this thesis, we focus on managing the propagation of change impact at 
                            several levels of granularity and abstraction of business process models (BPM) in order to master 
                            change management in this type of process. We start by analyzing the dependencies between activities, 
                            data and the roles of actors in a business process. For this, we have developed a prototype tool where 
                            facts are collected and analyzed in the form of a matrix.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, we improved our approach by adding the semantic aspect by defining an ontology of BPMN 2.0 
                            dependencies. The latter makes it possible to store in a structured manner the information obtained 
                            from different versions of business processes, to map and manipulate the elements necessary for 
                            predicting the impact of changing a business process. A third contribution makes it possible to predict 
                            the level of change in BPM models. We defined three levels of change (low, medium, and high) based on 
                            structural metrics used in the predictive model. Five different machine learning algorithms are used and 
                            then evaluated in this study. The experiments carried out show the improvement in performance using the 
                            SVM and Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithms.

                            <strong>Doctoral Student:</strong> Moncef Garouani<br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning (ML) has penetrated all aspects of modern life, and brought 
                            more convenience and satisfaction for variables of interest. However, building such solutions is a time 
                            consuming and challenging process that requires highly technical expertise. This certainly engages many 
                            more people, not necessarily experts, to perform analytics tasks. While the selection and the 
                            parametrization of ML models require tedious episodes of trial and error. Additionally, domain experts 
                            often lack the expertise to apply advanced analytics. Consequently, they intend frequent consultations 
                            with data scientists. However, these collaborations often result in increased costs in terms of undesired 
                            delays. It thus can lead risks such as human-resource bottlenecks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently, as the tasks become more complex, similarly the more support solutions are needed for the 
                            increased ML usability for the non-ML masters. To that end, Automated ML (AutoML) is a data-mining 
                            formalism with the aim of reducing human effort and readily improving the development cycle through 
                            automation. The field of AutoML aims to make these decisions in a data-driven, objective, and automated 
                            way. Thereby, AutoML makes ML techniques accessible to domain scientists who are interested in applying 
                            advanced analytics but lack the required expertise. This can be seen as a democratization of ML.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AutoML is usually treated as an algorithms selection and parametrization problem. In this regard, existing 
                            approaches include Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms as well as reinforcement learning. These 
                            approaches have focused on providing user assistance by automating parts or the entire data analysis 
                            process, but without being concerned on its impact on the analysis. The goal has generally been focused on 
                            the performance factors, thus leaving aside other important and even crucial aspects such as computational 
                            complexity, confidence and transparency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast, this thesis aims at developing alternative methods that provide assistance in building 
                            appropriate modeling techniques while providing the rationale for the selected models. In particular, we 
                            consider this important demand in intelligent assistance as a meta-analysis process, and we make progress 
                            towards addressing two challenges in AutoML research. First, to overcome the computational complexity 
                            problem, we studied a formulation of AutoML as a recommendation problem, and proposed a new 
                            conceptualization of a Meta-Learning (MtL)-based expert system capable of recommending optimal ML pipelines 
                            for a given task; Second, we investigated the automatic explainability aspect of the AutoML process to 
                            address the problem of the acceptance of, and the trust in such black-boxes support systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To this end, we have designed and implemented a framework architecture that leverages ideas from MtL to learn 
                            the relationship between a new set of datasets meta-data and mining algorithms. This eventually enables 
                            recommending ML pipelines according to their potential impact on the analysis. To guide the development of 
                            our work, we chose to focus on the Industry 4.0 as a main field of application for all the constraints it 
                            offers. Finally, in this doctoral thesis, we focus on the user assistance in the algorithms selection and 
                            tuning step. We devise an architecture and build a tool, AMLBID, that provides users support with the aim of 
                            improving the analysis and decreasing the amount of time spent in algorithms selection and parametrization. 
                            It is a tool that for the first time does not aim at providing data analysis support only, but instead, it 
                            is oriented towards positively contributing to the trust in such powerful support systems by automatically 
                            providing a set of explanation levels to inspect the provided results.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Logistics problems are often complex combinatorial problems. These may also 
                            implicitly refer to the processes, actors, activities, and methods concerning various aspects that need to 
                            be considered. Thus the same process may involve the processes of sale/purchase, transport/delivery, and 
                            stock management. These processes are so diverse and interconnected that it is difficult for a logistic 
                            expert to compete all of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this thesis, we propose the explications with the help of ontologies of conceptual and semantic knowledge 
                            concerning the logistic processes. This explicit knowledge is then used to develop a reasoning system to 
                            guide the logistic expert for an incremental and semi-automatic construction of a software solution to an 
                            instantly posed problem. We define an ontology concerning the inter-connected logistics and associated 
                            optimization problem. We, henceforth, establish an explicit semantic link between the domains of logistics 
                            and the optimization. It may allow the logistic expert to identify precisely and unambiguously the 
                            confronted logistic problem and the associated optimization problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The identification of the problems then leads to a process to choose the solutions ranging from the choice 
                            of the precise logistic process to be implemented to that of the method to solve the combinatorial problem 
                            until the discovery of the software component to be invoked and which is implemented by a web service. The 
                            approach we have adopted and implemented has been experimented with the "Vehicle Routing Problems", the 
                            "Passenger Train Problem" and the "Container Terminal problems".

                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> The evolution management of the business processes requires an exhaustive 
                            understanding of the change. An evolution engineer needs to understand reasons of a change, its application 
                            levels, and subsequently its impact on the whole system. In this thesis, we propose an approach for an a 
                            priori change impact analysis, to better control the business process evolution. This may help the business 
                            experts and the process designers to evaluate change impact in order to reduce the associated risks and 
                            estimate the related costs. It may also help to improve the service and quality of the business processes.

                            This work contributes an eventual improvement, in regard, to verify the coherence and the compliance of the 
                            business process models, after each change. It leads to evaluate an a priori change impact analysis in 
                            structural and qualitative aspects. The multiple-perspectives of the proposed approach have been reviewed 
                            experimentally. The validation of the approach is evaluated by extending the Eclipse Development Environment, 
                            with the help of a set of plug-ins, as a prototype platform.

                    <h3>CPS Configuration Recommendation System</h3>
                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>
                            We are developing a CPS Recommendation Engine capable of generating configurations of CPS (Cyber-Physical 
                            Systems). This recommendation system aims to suggest adapted solutions based on users' specific needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>CPS recommendation system</strong> is a tool to provide users with optimized configurations 
                            based on their specific needs. Data collection, whether technical data on CPS components, processing 
                            algorithms, or user feedback, is fundamental to guarantee the accuracy and relevance of recommendations. 
                            Through an approach combining needs analysis, configuration optimization, and decision support, this system 
                            will help select the most adapted CPS solutions for scenarios as varied as sports performance monitoring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system begins by understanding the user's specific needs through questions asked by the chatbot 
                            (previously developed) or guided forms. For example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What sport is practiced by the athlete?</li>
                            <li>What performance indicators should be monitored (heart rate, speed, power)?</li>
                            <li>What is the duration or frequency of training sessions?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once the needs are understood, the system recommends an adapted CPS configuration, relying on a database of 
                            available devices and sensors. Filtering is done based on criteria such as sensor accuracy, device 
                            compatibility with each other, and budget constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to proposing an initial selection of sensors and equipment, the system optimizes the 
                            configuration based on the environment (indoor or outdoor), connection mode (wireless or wired), and user 
                            requirements (real-time, post-event analysis).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system also proposes data analysis algorithms adapted to the sports domain, such as signal processing 
                            algorithms to analyze sensor data in real-time, or machine learning algorithms for prediction and 
                            long-term performance analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The recommendation system allows the user to adjust the proposed suggestions (choice of sensors, connectivity, 
                            etc.), based on their preferences or feedback from experience.
                        </p>
