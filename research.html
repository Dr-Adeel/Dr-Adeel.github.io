                                My research work builds upon previously conducted research while integrating a semantic dimension 
                                into software evolution analysis. The main objective is to establish a semi-automatic mechanism 
                                for <strong>semantic annotation</strong> of artifacts and processes related to software evolution 
                                management, through a <strong>semantic orchestration represented in the form of graphs</strong>.

                            <p>
                                This approach enables multidimensional analysis of data, including actors in the software lifecycle 
                                as well as various types of users. It also aims to formalize semantic relationships between business 
                                domains and software systems, particularly through the adoption of an ontology dedicated to business 
                                process models.

                                Currently, my work focuses on developing a semantic annotation mechanism applied to artifacts related 
                                to the theme of <strong>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</strong>. This orientation aims to 
                                establish bridges between research conducted by different members of the SysReIC group, thus contributing 
                                to better integration of expertise within the LISIC laboratory.

                                LISIC's commitment to the field of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through the creation of 
                                the humAIn alliance, as well as the growing importance of implementation processes for solutions based 
                                on AI algorithms—including those from machine learning—have led to a reorientation of our research work. 
                                This evolution aims to mobilize knowledge management approaches as a methodological lever to support 
                                the design and implementation of these processes.

                                In this dynamic, the SysReIC group, to which I belong, has set itself the mission of developing 
                                research axes centered on the integration of knowledge management into the processes of developing 
                                AI solutions. A central theme emerges from this orientation: the explainability of artificial intelligence 
                                systems.

                                We are currently conducting in-depth work on this issue, with the aim of better understanding how 
                                mechanisms for structuring, representing, and mobilizing knowledge can contribute to improving the 
                                transparency, comprehensibility, and interpretability of AI systems.

                                My main skills are related to knowledge management, particularly in knowledge-based systems based on rules. 
                                My research work has been oriented towards the development of systems and decision support platforms to 
                                better understand knowledge and its semantics. I am involved with my other colleagues to defend the idea 
                                that a better understanding of knowledge and its semantics could benefit from explainability in AI. I work 
                                with my colleagues to validate this idea and develop research projects that use knowledge management as 
                                support for the implementation of AI processes, particularly with regard to AI explainability.

                                experts who are not necessarily computer science experts, in order to help them better use and exploit

                            <h3>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</h3>
                            <p>
                                I actively participate in writing research topics and various reports related to projects in which the 
                                team is involved, with the objective of co-directing this work. The work envisaged by the SysReIC research 
                                group mainly concerns knowledge management and its application to problems related to artificial intelligence, 
                                particularly on AI explainability. We have also been able to obtain funding for co-supervised theses and 
                                several Master 2 level research internships that have joined our team around these topics concerning AI 
                                explainability. As a member of the group, I also have the role of co-supervising this research work.

                            <p>
                                My current research work is devoted to the issue of explainability of reasoning processes in Artificial 
                                Intelligence systems. This issue has become a major concern in the field of AI and has been highlighted 
                                in numerous works, such as the Villani report on AI. It is clearly established that the lack of "explainability" 
                                of AIs constitutes a serious obstacle to the development of AI in critical and/or sensitive domains, such as 
                                medicine, autonomous vehicle driving, or decision support systems in social domains, such as the allocation 
                                of study grants and/or social housing, etc. My work therefore aims to develop methods and tools to improve 
                                the explainability of AI systems, particularly by using approaches based on knowledge management. This contributes 
                                to strengthening trust in AI systems and facilitating their adoption in critical and/or sensitive domains.

                            <h3>Deep Neural Networks and Explainability</h3>
                            <p>
                                Many works have been carried out in recent years to add explanations to AI systems, particularly those based 
                                on deep neural networks, which are both very performant but, in principle, designed and implemented as black 
                                boxes. Deep neural networks are used in many domains, such as speech recognition, computer vision, automatic 
                                translation, and modeling of natural processes. However, due to their complexity, these systems are often 
                                difficult to understand and explain, which can make it difficult to understand their decisions and their 
                                acceptability in critical domains. For this reason, many researchers are working on the explainability of 
                                deep neural networks in order to understand their internal functioning and make their decisions more 
                                comprehensible and transparent for users. This can also contribute to the trust and acceptance of these 
                                systems by the public.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Research Approaches to XAI</h3>
                            <p>
                                The most recent research work explores various avenues to achieve explainability of AI systems. For example, 
                                some tools perform processing on AI models in order to reify the links between data and a model that led to 
                                a specific decision. Other work aims to produce simplified versions of existing AI models. Finally, some work 
                                attempts to alter the very process of model generation in order to directly provide more explainable models. 
                                While approaches differ, their common goal is to produce AI systems that can provide explanations that are 
                                understandable by the human actors concerned, such as doctors, production or maintenance engineers, etc. 
                                From our point of view, it is a matter of producing explanations at a level of semantic abstraction in 
                                accordance with their knowledge. The study of the state of the art allows us to observe that while these 
                                notions of knowledge and adapted semantics are often implicit, they themselves are still rarely reified.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My research work fits into this framework and aims to demonstrate that approaches for explainability would 
                                strongly benefit from a more in-depth consideration of knowledge and its semantics as first-order objects by 
                                explicitly linking them to AI systems through tools that allow them to be explicated and manipulated, such 
                                as knowledge graphs and ontologies. They will address both the business domain considered and user profiles, 
                                as well as the nature of the AI algorithms used and their specificities. These developed works are at the 
                                heart of the SysReIC working group theme.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Knowledge-Based Systems and Explanation</h3>
                            <p>
                                Since the appearance of Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), the need for explanation of reasoning has always been 
                                felt. This is motivated by a user's need to be reassured about how the KBS obtained its result or for debugging 
                                during the development of this system. Another reason is the use of reasoning explanation as a means of learning 
                                the application domain (medicine, banking and finance, etc.).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If in the past KBS were essentially based on rules, currently we speak rather of intelligent systems combining 
                                machine learning techniques, knowledge about application domains explicated in particular by ontologies based on 
                                description logics. The multiplicity of techniques used and the exponential size of ontologies can make the 
                                results of reasoning performed by intelligent systems difficult to grasp by different types of users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The work first conducts a study of the state of the art of current work on reasoning explanation in intelligent 
                                systems. The notion of explanation is first apprehended in its traditional version by studying approaches 
                                developed for more than 40 years and for which a well-supplied bibliography already exists. Subsequently, current 
                                approaches are reviewed, considering those interested in description logic reasoners (ontologies) as well as those 
                                using machine learning techniques. Then, the work aims to show the importance of considering knowledge and its 
                                semantics as first-order objects by explicitly linking them to AI systems through tools that allow them to be 
                                explicated, such as knowledge graphs and ontologies.
