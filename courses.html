                                as well as at EILCO (École d'Ingénieurs du Littoral-Côte-d'Opale) and in various other components 
                                such as STAPS, SV, DEUST on the Calais campus. I also provide certain services and pedagogical 
                                responsibilities on the Longuenesse campus (Digital Skills STAPS, DEUST) as well as in 
                                Boulogne-sur-Mer (DU Tremplin).

                            <p>
                                I teach in various computer science disciplines, with diverse audiences in both bachelor's and 
                                master's programs. I have taught as a module coordinator, including courses, tutorials (TD), 
                                and practical work (TP) for all modules dedicated to databases across the three years of the 
                                computer science bachelor's degree, as well as in the first year of the Master Web and Data 
                                Science (WeDSci). In the Master in Complex Systems Engineering (MISC), I am responsible for 
                                the Object-Oriented Programming and Web Development modules. Additionally, I am also responsible 
                                for the E-Services module in the third year (bac+5 level) of the Computer Engineering cycle at EILCO. 
                                I design these modules as well as the associated teaching materials, distributed online via the 
                                Moodle platform, and I ensure individual student follow-up through Moodle with the integration of 
                                interactive tools such as Wooclap and Wooflash.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also lead an introductory training course on digital tools for first-year students at ULCO, 
                                within several components (STAPS, DEUST, SV, etc.). The number of students varies each year, 
                                around 300 students in this training program.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, I supervise numerous end-of-study projects and internships in industrial companies each year.

                            <p>
                                I have also trained several colleagues and external contributors, including M. Zribi (MCF, Dept. Info. 
                                et Signal), QURIS Axel (External Part-time Lecturer), Farouk YAHAYA (ATER ULCO), MEYERS Laurane 
                                (Part-time Lecturer), Eric DUQUENOY (MCF ULCO), Valentin Bourlois (PhD Student/Part-time Lecturer), 
                                Jérôme BOUDET (External Part-time Lecturer), Aymeric Blot (ATER ULCO), and Hamdi Yahya (ATER ULCO), 
                                to name just a few, regarding the use of software platforms and the design and implementation of 
                                various modules.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Innovative Teaching Methodologies</h3>
                            <p>
                                In my teaching, I use innovative methodologies that help me manage the heterogeneity of student levels. 
                                In this regard, I use collaborative tools and innovative pedagogical strategies. I prefer to use 
                                interactive tools to better manage large audiences and communicate interactively with students. 
                                To this end, I use platforms like Moodle (which replaced Sakai) to manage module content, as well as 
                                real-time question-and-answer systems, such as Kahoot and Wooclap, which offer automated corrections. 
                                For this purpose, I have attended training sessions provided by the companies that created these tools. 
                                I also develop custom scripts to automate corrections and track student learning. It was during the 
                                lockdown that I was able to easily adopt online tools for pedagogical purposes, e.g., Courses, TD, and 
                                TP via Discord servers, Starleaf, and Zoom depending on the students' level of mastery.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my teaching practices, I adopt innovative methodologies to ensure better student understanding. 
                                Among these innovative approaches, I strive to implement effective strategies to manage large groups, 
                                promote interactivity, and encourage student engagement. I also use automated correction tools such as 
                                online questionnaires, which allow for rapid and objective assessment of student performance. These 
                                tools promote immediate feedback and enable personalization of learning by identifying individual 
                                student needs. To illustrate, I mention the use of the Quescussion methodology, where I ask a student 
                                to answer a question and end their answer with a question for a classmate, thus encouraging participation 
                                and collaborative thinking.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Professional Development</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order to respond coherently to the evolution of student-centered teaching methodologies and the 
                                contextualization of learning, I also engage in training to adapt to the evolution of teaching methodologies. 
                                To this end, I have regularly participated in various training sessions and workshops offered by CIP'Ulco. 
                                Here is a non-exhaustive list of my participations:
